# How to Get Your Facebook Data
How do we actually get our hands on our Facebook data? Well, itâ€™s actually easier than you might think. As of right now (August 20th, 2018), you can download your data by:

* Log into Facebook
* Click settings
* In the your informations section, Click the third option is "Download your informations" 
* From here, you can decide what data you want, for what time period, and what format

For this project I chose to download everything for all time, and in a JSON format.
