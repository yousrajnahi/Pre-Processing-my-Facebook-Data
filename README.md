This project aims to provide a tool for preprocessing and cleaning Facebook data downloaded from the platform.


## How to Get Your Facebook Data
You can download your data by by following these steps:

* Log into Facebook
* Click settings
* In the your informations section, Click the third option is "Download your informations" 
* From here, you can decide what data you want, for what time period, and what format

For this project I chose to download everything for all time, and in a JSON format.
